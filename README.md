# Installing & Running

## Dependencies

* A modern version of Node.js (Tested on v0.10.24)
* A media player which can play remote files over HTTP and can be launched from a terminal. Tested:
  * VLC
  * OMXPlayer
* Plex hosted somewhere with a library of TV Shows

## Starting NodeJSMediaCentre (Required Environment Variables)
* OMX_PLAYER - Set the command and flags used when called for playback. EG: 'omxplayer '
* PLEX_SERVER - Hostname of your Plex Server
* PLEX_SERVER_PORT - Port of your Plex Server

Set all these (Or use one of the helper scripts listed below), then:

    node server.js
     
Then open a browser and navigate to:

    http://localhost:8080/gui/app.html

## Installing Standalone on a Raspberry Pi

* Start with the latest Raspbian image
* Re-configure the boot image of the Pi to have atleast TODO graphics memory
* Install latest Node.js
* Install latest OMXPlayer
* Checkout NodeJSMediaCentre from Github
* Edit run script (EG: run-pi-hdmi-audio.sh) to set your player options, and Plex hostname/port

## Pre-provided helper scripts

* run-pi-hdmi-audio.sh - Uses OMXPlayer, outputting audio over HDMI. A good starting point on the Raspberry Pi.
* run-pi-local-audio.sh - Uses OMXPlayer, outputting audio over 3.5mm jack.
* run-mac-vlc.sh - Calls VLC in the default install path on OSX. Works passibly, but keycontrol of the player doesn't work.
